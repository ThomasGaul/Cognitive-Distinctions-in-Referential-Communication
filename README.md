 # Cognitive Distinctions in a Model of Referential Communciation

This is a minimal model of referential communication used to explore the concept of cognitive distinctions. This repository contains the code for the evolution and analysis of agents in a referential communication task. The work has been under review for publication in the *Artificial Life* journal since October 2023. A preprint is available on [my website](https://thomasgaul.github.io/publication/2024-ReferComm).

The environment is a one-dimensional ring with 'post-sets' that agents can interact with. The agents are 5-neuron CTRNNs with a single continuous sensor. The task is organised into three phases:

1. *Phase 1*. The sender interacts with the target to differentiate whether it has one or two posts.
2. *Phase 2*. The sender interacts with the receiver to prepare the latter to find the correct post-set.
3. *Phase 3*. The receiver finds and stays near the target post-set, ignoring the distraction post-set.
